=head2 RFC 1: DBConnection or DBContext ?

DBConnection is the module in EnsEMBL code to store the database information,
such as host, dbname, etc;
while DBContext is a BioPerl-DB module having the same function as
DBConnection in EnsEMBL.
However, the usage of these similar modules are different in these 2 systems.

DBAdaptor in EnsEMBL inherits DBConnection, there is a IS_A relationship,
while Bio::DB::BioDB owns DBContext and construct a HAS_A relationship.
"As a very general remark, replacing containment (association) with inheritance
is rarely a good idea; most of the time people refactor their code in 
the opposite direction. - Hilmar"

So I choose the DBContext style as the method grant Adaptor the database 
access information.

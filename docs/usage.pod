=head1 Usage of AutoSQL system

I suggest you to read another doc, if you did not, The Overview.

There are two levels you can use this system. But with whichever level, 
the fundamental understanding on the system described on the Overview is needed.
The high-level usage absolutely doesn't mean you need to understand how this
system works less than with low-level usage.
